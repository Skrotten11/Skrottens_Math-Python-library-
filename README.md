# Skrottens_Math-Python-library-
Welcome to Skrottens Math! This is a simple math library containing the following functions:

add(),
substract(),
multiply(),
divide(),

How to use:
   -If you for example wish to add two numbers, use the add function like this: Skrottens_Math.add(value1, value2)
    
    This will return the answer. The other functions are used completely similar.
    
    -The library folder should be located in same folder as project.
     
     Example: /myproject
               |
               |
               -/Skrottens_Math
               |
               -/project.py

Note: This library is just a test-project i made to learn making libraries- Though it is fully functional and correct!

Thanks for reading!!
